# Embedded System Simulator for a Hypothetical Patient Monitoring Device

This project is a simulation of an embedded system for a hypothetical patient monitoring device. The system is divided into two main components: firmware that simulates the device's functionality, and a central system software that simulates the interaction of healthcare professionals with the device.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a C++ compiler installed on your local machine to run the project. 

### Running the project

1. Compile the firmware_simulation.cpp file and run the executable. This simulates the patient monitoring device generating vital sign data and writing it to a text file. 

2. Compile the centralSystemSoftware.cpp file and run the executable. This simulates the interaction of healthcare professionals with the device, reading the vital sign data from the text file and displaying it.
